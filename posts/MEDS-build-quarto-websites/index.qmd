## Abstract

A personal website is not only a great way to showcase your experiences and skills, but also gives people (potential employers included!) a better sense of who you are as a person. There are lots of great ways to build websites using R (e.g. `{distill}`, `{blogdown}`) â€“ this workshop uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an exciting, new(ish), and versatile publishing tool that supports R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS.
