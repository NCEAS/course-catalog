## Abstract



`Git` is a great tool for working independently, but even better for working with friends and colleagues. Git allows you to work on your local copy of files with the confidence that you can successfully synchronize your changes with the changes made by others. This lesson presents step-by-step how to start collaborating with colleagues and avoiding conflicts. It also walks you through what can cause a merge conflict, how to solve a merge conflict, and things to consider to avoid conflicts in general.
