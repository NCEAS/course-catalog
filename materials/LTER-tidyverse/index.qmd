## Abstract

This workshop provides an overview of many of the packages included in the Tidyverse suite of packages for the R programming language. The Tidyverse is a veritable universe of tools though that no single workshop could hope to cover so we are focusing here on an introductory approach that focuses primarily on some fundamentals to tidying data in R.
